<br />
This contribution will create a unique Order Number, which is basically based on php's date() function.<br />
<br />
The order number will consist of: Month, Year, Hour, Minute, Second. Basically:<br />
<br />
date(&quot;mdY-His&quot;) = mmddyyyy-hhmmss (14 DIGITS)<br />
<br />
You could abreviate the Year to &quot;y&quot; which will give mmddyyhhmmss (12 DIGITS)<br />
<br />
